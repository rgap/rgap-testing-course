# 🧪 Test-Driven Development: Key Concepts

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is more than a testing technique — it’s a **design methodology** that transforms the way we build software.

## 🧠 Core TDD Ideas

### ✅ Test First, Not After

- Tests are written _before_ the implementation.
- Forces developers to define expected behavior before writing logic.
- Prevents ambiguous APIs and reduces guesswork.

### 🔧 Tests Drive Design

- The test acts as a **user of the code**, which defines how the code should be structured.
- By writing a test first, you naturally define:
  - The function name
  - Its arguments
  - Its return type
  - Its expected behavior
- Helps identify missing edge cases early.

### 📑 Tests as Living Documentation

- Clear, well-named tests explain exactly how a function should behave.
- Unlike comments, tests **can’t go stale** — they fail if the implementation changes.
- Useful for new team members trying to understand the system.

### ⚠️ Fail Fast

- A failing test is not a problem — it's **valuable feedback**.
- Helps detect mistakes early and often.
- The earlier a bug is caught, the cheaper it is to fix.

### ♻️ Refactor After Green

- Once a test passes, it’s safe to refactor.
- Encourages clean, modular, and readable code.
- Avoids premature optimization or overengineering.

## 🏗 Real-World Example: Login Form

Throughout this folder, we’ll use a **login function** as a consistent example.

- Input: A username and password
- Goal: Check if the credentials are valid
- Output: A result message like `"Login successful"` or `"Missing credentials"`

Using this familiar example helps demonstrate how TDD principles work in a realistic context.

| `1_test_first_vs_test_last/` | Compares what happens when you write tests before vs after implementation. |
| `2_tests_drive_design/`      | Shows how a test helps shape the function interface and logic.             |
| `3_tests_as_documentation/`  | Demonstrates how tests can serve as documentation for expected behavior.   |

## 🚀 Why It Matters for Developers

TDD is not just for QA or senior engineers — it's a **developer discipline** that:

- Improves your confidence in code changes
- Encourages smaller and safer iterations
- Makes collaboration easier through readable, tested interfaces
- Builds a foundation for continuous delivery and agile workflows
