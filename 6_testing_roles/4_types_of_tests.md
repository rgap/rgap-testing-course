# üß™ Types of Software Tests

Software testing involves many different kinds of tests, each with a unique **scope**, **goal**, and **typical performer** (devs, QAs, automation, etc.).

---

## üß± Unit Testing

- ‚úÖ Tests a **single function or method** in isolation
- Written by developers
- Fast and small in scope

> Example: Testing `calculateTotal()` without any database or API calls

---

## üîó Integration Testing

- ‚úÖ Verifies that **multiple units/modules work together**
- Tests real-world flows across layers (e.g., API + DB)
- May involve stubs, fakes, or actual services

> Example: Testing a user registration endpoint that writes to a real database

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- ‚úÖ Simulates **real user scenarios**
- Clicks buttons, fills forms, navigates screens
- Requires full app + backend + DB + network

> Example: Logging in via UI and validating a welcome message

---

## üåê API Testing

- ‚úÖ Focuses on **REST, GraphQL, or RPC APIs**
- Sends real requests and checks responses
- Often automated and run in CI

> Tools: Postman, Newman, Supertest, REST Assured

---

## üîÅ Regression Testing

- ‚úÖ Ensures that **new changes don‚Äôt break old features**
- Can be manual or automated
- Re-runs all or most tests before deploy

> Usually done before release or after hotfix

---

## üß≠ Smoke Testing

- ‚úÖ Basic check to confirm the app ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt crash‚Äù
- Shallow tests of major features
- Often run **right after deployment**

> Example: Verifying that login and homepage load after deploy

---

## üß® Load & Performance Testing

- ‚úÖ Measures **response times**, **concurrency**, and **scalability**
- Simulates many users or requests
- Important for backend, APIs, or heavy traffic systems

> Tools: JMeter, Locust, Artillery

---

## ü¶∫ Security Testing

- ‚úÖ Checks for **vulnerabilities** and exploits
- Includes input validation, auth, injection, etc.
- Done by security engineers or specialized tools

> Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Snyk

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Testing

- ‚úÖ Validates **screen readers, keyboard use, ARIA labels**
- Ensures compliance with a11y standards
- Performed manually or using tools

> Tools: Axe, Lighthouse, Wave

---

## üîç Manual Testing

- ‚úÖ Human testers explore or follow scripts
- Useful for exploratory, UX, or edge cases
- May be supported by spreadsheets or test plans
